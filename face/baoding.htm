			<p class="para">I grow up in a city called Baoding, it's a small city of northern China. My parents are quiet people who are bad at expressing their emotions, but they manage to show me their love in their actions. I am really grateful that they have been supporting me to realise my dream since my undergraduate period.

			Yang, Zhou and Huan are my best friends in high school and we have been in close touch with each other for a long time. Whenever we can meet online/offline, we grab the chance to talk about each other's life updates. I will cherish the precious friendship with them. </p>
